If you live in Baltimore, you have a 1 in 15 chance of being a victim of any crime. It is arguably America’s most dangerous city with burglary, larceny and robbery representing 72% of its total crime. These three categories, all falling under the umbrella of “theft”, are addressed in this report which provides findings on their contributing factors and potential solutions. The "Business Question", if you will, of this report is: what are the factors that contribute to the abnormally high amount of theft in Baltimore and how can we work with these factors to lessen theft rates. The factors found to be significant are lack of education and unemployment. However, counterintuitively, citizen's lack of education and unemployment were discovered to hold a significant negative correlation to districts' theft rates. Nevertheless, the majority of perpetrators were unemployed and had minal educational background. This report explains the reason for this dichotomy and provides solutions involving effective government and police policies that will greatly reduce crime in Baltimore.   
# Why This is a Problem
Crime destroys communities. It does so by evoking fear within the populace, leading to major socioeconomic repercussions. Local stores lose their customers, who no longer feel comfortable walking through commercial areas. Hotels and restaurants lose revenue from tourists, who decide upon safer vacation destinations. Worst of all, city residents lose their liberty, confined within the safety of their homes. One concrete impact of crime is loss of property value. According to the Economic Journal, just a 10% decrease in domestic property crime adds more than a 1.7% increase to a home's market price. The Economic Journal's study illustrates how crime affects everyone in a community in one way or another. To address this issue, this report targets Baltimore’s three most prevalent categories of crime and offers the much needed solutions to help mitigate the city's crime epidemic.
